# Smart-Home-IoT

This project is in collaboration with my college friends : Iman Wahyu, Desi Fitriana

I made a smart sensor IoT project with ESP32, incorporating RFID, KY-037, and magnetic switch sensors. The ESP32 serves as the central hub, connecting seamlessly to Arduino IoT Cloud for remote monitoring and control

I programmed it using Arduino IDE software and Arduino Cloud server for IoT.
